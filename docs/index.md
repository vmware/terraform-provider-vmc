# Terraform Provider for VMware Cloud on AWS

The Terraform Provider for [VMware Cloud on AWS][product-documentation] is a plugin for Terraform that allows you to
interact with VMware Cloud on AWS.

## Example Usage

In order to use the provider you need to obtain the authentication token from the Cloud Service Provider by providing
the org scoped API token. The provider client uses Cloud Service Provider (CSP) API to exchange this org scoped API
token/OAuth App ID and Secret for user access token.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    vcf = {
      source  = "vmware/vmc"
      version = "x.y.z"
    }
  }
}

provider "vmc" {
  refresh_token = var.api_token
  org_id        = var.org_id
}

data "vmc_connected_accounts" "my_accounts" {
  account_number = var.aws_account_number
}

data "vmc_customer_subnets" "my_subnets" {
  connected_account_id = data.vmc_connected_accounts.my_accounts.id
  region               = var.sddc_region
}

resource "vmc_sddc" "sddc_1" {
  sddc_name           = var.sddc_name
  vpc_cidr            = var.vpc_cidr
  num_host            = var.sddc_num_hosts
  provider_type       = "AWS"
  region              = data.vmc_customer_subnets.my_subnets.region
  vxlan_subnet        = var.vxlan_subnet
  delay_account_link  = false
  skip_creating_vxlan = false
  sso_domain          = "vmc.local"

  deployment_type = "SingleAZ"

  account_link_sddc_config {
    customer_subnet_ids  = [data.vmc_customer_subnets.my_subnets.ids[0]]
    connected_account_id = data.vmc_connected_accounts.my_accounts.id
  }

  timeouts {
    create = "300m"
    update = "300m"
    delete = "180m"
  }
}

resource "vmc_public_ip" "public_ip_1" {
  nsxt_reverse_proxy_url = vmc_sddc.sddc_1.nsxt_reverse_proxy_url
  display_name           = var.public_ip_displayname
}
```
